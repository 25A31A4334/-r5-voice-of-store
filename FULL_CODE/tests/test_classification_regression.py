"""Comprehensive Classification Regression Tests for R5 Voice of Store Engine.

Verifies:
1. All 7 core regression examples:
   - "Worst hospitality" -> IT03 (Unhelpful or poorly trained staff), HR, low, non-actionable (0)
   - "The staff were very rude" -> IT03 (Unhelpful or poorly trained staff), HR, low, non-actionable (0)
   - "The cashier was unhelpful" -> IT03 (Unhelpful or poorly trained staff), HR, low, non-actionable (0)
   - "The vegetables were rotten" -> IT15 (Poor quality fresh produce), Supply Chain, low, actionable (1)
   - "The milk was spoiled" -> IT16 (Expired / near-expiry product on shelf), Store Ops, high (policy floor), actionable (1)
   - "The refrigerator is not working" -> IT10 (Refrigeration / cold-chain failure), Store Ops, high (policy floor), non-actionable (0)
   - "The store was clean and staff were polite" -> NI01 (Praise / compliment), None, low, non-actionable (0)
2. Live REST endpoint POST /api/classify behavior.
3. Live customer submission POST /api/customer/submissions for "Worst hospitality".
4. Store manager inbox visibility and lifecycle actions for corrected customer submissions.
5. Preservation of other major categories (billing IT01, hygiene IT06, stock IT14, delivery IT23, app crash IT26).
