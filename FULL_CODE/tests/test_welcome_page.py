"""
Regression and Verification Tests for Voice of Store Engine Public Welcome Page.

Verifies:
1. Public Welcome Page is rendered at `/` with HTTP 200.
2. Branding compliance: Product name is strictly 'Voice of Store Engine';
   no code name 'R5', no team name 'CodeNova', and no hackathon branding in visible UI.
3. Hero section: Contains headline, supporting text, CTA buttons, and visual flow.
4. Platform Features: 6 features with transparent operational status badges.
5. How It Works: 4-step workflow from raw feedback to closed-loop resolution.
6. User Portals: 3 distinct cards (Customer, Store Manager, Administrator) with distinct login triggers.
7. Public SaaS Footer: Brand name, SaaS summary, navigation links, and copyright.
8. Security: Protected endpoints require authentication; public landing page does not leak protected data.
